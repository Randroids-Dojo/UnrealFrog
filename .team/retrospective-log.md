# Retrospective Log

*Chronological record of all team retrospectives and the changes they produced.*

---

## Retrospective 0 — Team Formation

### Context
Initial team formation. No development work yet. Establishing baseline agreements.

### Starting Agreements
- See `.team/agreements.md` for Day 0 agreements
- Mob programming, TDD mandatory, conventional commits
- These are intentionally minimal — we expect them to evolve rapidly

### Open Questions for First Retrospective
- [ ] Are 8 agents the right number, or do some roles overlap?
- [ ] Is opus the right model for all agents, or should some use sonnet?
- [ ] How long should driver rotation intervals be?
- [ ] Do we need explicit WIP limits beyond "one feature at a time"?
