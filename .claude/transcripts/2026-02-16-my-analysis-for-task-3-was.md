<teammate-message teammate_id="devops-engineer" color="green" summary="Analysis already sent, confirming receipt">
My analysis for Task #3 was already sent to you earlier in this session. Check your inbox for the message titled "Tooling gap analysis: web vs UE agent workflows" -- it's the full writeup covering the fundamental gap, current PlayUnreal state, three tiers of proposals, and the top 3 concrete investments. Let me know if you didn't receive it or need any clarification.

Got it, I already received and captured your analysis. No issues -- it's logged and ready for synthesis. Thanks for confirming.

Still waiting for **game-designer** and **qa-lead** analyses.
