<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Retro complete, shutting down team">
Retro finalized, Sprint 7 plan written, agreements updated with Section 18. All votes recorded. Thank you for the honest perspectives — this was the best retro we've had. Shutting down the team now.

Good retro. The key outcomes from my side — SaveHighScore write frequency fix and wave-complete dedup as Sprint 7 P0s, coordinator extraction deferred to Sprint 8, domain-expert review policy — are all solid decisions that match the codebase's actual needs.
