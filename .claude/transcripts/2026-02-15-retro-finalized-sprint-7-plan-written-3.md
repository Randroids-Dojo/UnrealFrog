<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Retro complete, shutting down team">
Retro finalized, Sprint 7 plan written, agreements updated with Section 18. All votes recorded. Thank you for the honest perspectives — this was the best retro we've had. Shutting down the team now.
</teammate-message>

Good retro. The QA play-test accountability via commit tags (Section 18) and the post-implementation review agreement are the two most important process changes. If those stick in Sprint 7 the way per-subsystem commits stuck in Sprint 6, the team's biggest gap will be closed.

Ready for shutdown whenever the team lead sends the request.
