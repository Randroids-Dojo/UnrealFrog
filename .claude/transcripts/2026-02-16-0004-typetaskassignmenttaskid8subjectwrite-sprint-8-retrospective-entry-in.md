Stale message -- Task 8 was already completed earlier in this session. This is another instance of the message lag pattern (Agreement Section 1). The retrospective entry is already written and committed to `/Users/randroid/Documents/Dev/Unreal/UnrealFrog/.team/retrospective-log.md`.

No action needed.
