<teammate-message teammate_id="game-designer" color="orange" summary="Option A already done, all files reverted and confirmed clean">
Option A is already done. I reverted all three files several messages ago when you first flagged the process issue. Confirmed clean with `git diff` -- zero diffs from HEAD on `UnrealFrogGameMode.h`, `GameStateTest.cpp`, and `sprint1-gameplay-spec.md`.

The seam test conflict is also resolved -- I told qa-lead to disregard my earlier value-change request.

Current state: all files at original values, analysis documented in messages, ready for play-test-first workflow.
