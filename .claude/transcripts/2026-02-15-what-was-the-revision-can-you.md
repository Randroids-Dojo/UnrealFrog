What was the revision? Can you summarize the changes Engine Architect requested and what you updated?

Sent the summary to the team lead. The key point: the revision was from xp-coach's feedback during task assignment, not from an Engine Architect review (which hasn't happened yet). The change still needs cross-domain review per agreement section 18.
