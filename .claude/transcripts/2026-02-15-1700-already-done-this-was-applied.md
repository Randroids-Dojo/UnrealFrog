<teammate-message teammate_id="qa-lead" color="yellow" summary="Already done — parameter-derived approach applied, not a blocker">
Already done — this was applied after your first heads-up. The recommended approach (parameter-derived values) is in place. No hardcoded `1.2f`, `1.6f`, or `320.0f` remain in the test.

Build: SUCCEEDED. Tests: 160/160 pass. This is not a blocker.

Acknowledged — QA Lead confirming what's already been established. No action needed. Waiting on team-lead to drive the build verify + commits for the two uncommitted changes (Task #14 + seam test refactor).
