<teammate-message teammate_id="game-designer" color="orange" summary="Already reverted, confirmed clean, process understood">
Already done. I reverted all three files as soon as the xp-coach flagged the process issue in the previous message. Confirmed clean -- no diffs from HEAD on any of my files.

The corrected workflow makes sense: play-test first with current values to establish a baseline, then apply tuning changes informed by both the analysis and actual gameplay observations. My analysis and recommendations are documented in the messages I sent earlier and ready to go when the time comes.

Acknowledged — the Game Designer is aligned and waiting. No action needed from them until the play-test.

The sprint is now in a holding pattern on one single item: the engine-architect's OnDyingComplete SaveHighScore fix. I have escalated to the team lead for a reassignment decision. Nothing more to do until one of them responds.
