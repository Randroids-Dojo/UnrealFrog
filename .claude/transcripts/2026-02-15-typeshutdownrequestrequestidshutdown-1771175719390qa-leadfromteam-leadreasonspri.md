Let me update my agent memory before shutting down.

Memory is already up to date with Sprint 7 lessons. The test count and key lessons are recorded. Let me add one more lesson about tuning-resilient tests.

The memory file has already been updated (likely by the retrospective). The Sprint 7 lessons are comprehensive. Good to shut down.
