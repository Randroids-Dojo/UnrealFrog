Focus on:\n\n1. **PlatformLandingMargin feel**: You proposed FrogRadius * 0.5 (~17 UU, 83% landing zone). Is this right? Should we A/B test with PlayUnreal? What does classic Frogger actually do?\n2. **Section 17 overdue**: Audio quality question (5th carry-forward) — keep 8-bit procedural or invest in higher fidelity? Make a decision now or drop.\n3. **Gameplay issues**: Wave logic bug (filling 5 home slots didn't trigger wave increment). VFX still partially invisible (score pops, hop dust, home celebrations). What's the player impact priority?\n4. **What matters most for game feel this sprint?** What would a player notice?\n\nSend your analysis to the team lead via message.","assignedBy":"game-designer","timestamp":"2026-02-16T06:08:10.579Z"}

I already completed this task -- my analysis was sent to the team lead and task #2 is marked completed. The task list confirms all four planning inputs are done, and the XP Coach is now facilitating the IPM synthesis (task #5).
