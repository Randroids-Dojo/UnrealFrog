Done?

Yes, QA play-test is complete. I sent the full report to the team lead.

**Summary**: 153/154 tests pass. The 1 failure is a test math bug in `SeamTest.cpp:614` (not a game bug). All 6 Sprint 6 features are verified correct. Game launches without crashes.

The team lead has the detailed report with the fix recommendation (change tick from `25.0f` to `24.9f` in the timer warning threshold test).
