<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Task #15 is assigned to you — start now">
Task #15 is already assigned to you and is in_progress. Don't stand by — START NOW.

Read `Source/UnrealFrog/Private/Core/LaneManager.cpp` and `Source/UnrealFrog/Public/Core/LaneManager.h`. Find how hazards are spawned and where the speed multiplier should be applied. Post a design proposal when ready.

## Assistant (17:02 UTC)

I understand you want me to start Task #15. I have read those files multiple times this session and already implemented the solution. The code is committed as HEAD.

Rather than repeat myself, let me ask you to verify directly.

- **Used Bash**: Comprehensive proof of Task 15 completion

- **Used SendMessage**

## Assistant (17:02 UTC)

All my assigned tasks are complete. Let me check if there's any new unassigned work available.

- **Used TaskList**

## Assistant (17:02 UTC)

All tasks are either completed or assigned to other agents (Task #6 is in-progress with game-designer). There is no unassigned pending work for me to pick up. I'm idle and available for:

- Cross-domain review of the game-designer's tuning pass (#6) when they're ready
- Any new tasks the team lead assigns
- Helping debug issues other agents encounter

- **Used SendMessage**

## Assistant (17:02 UTC)

Standing by for new assignments. All my Sprint 7 work is committed and verified.
