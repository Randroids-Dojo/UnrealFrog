## Assistant (04:18 UTC)

This is another stale self-assigned task notification from the very beginning of the session. Task 13 was completed long ago.

- **Used TaskGet** on task 13

## Assistant (04:18 UTC)

Confirmed -- Task 13 has been completed since the start of this session. Delayed message delivery, no action needed.

Standing by for new work from the team lead.
