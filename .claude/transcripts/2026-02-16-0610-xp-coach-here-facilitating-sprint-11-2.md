<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="orange" summary="IPM ready, requesting planning input from all agents">
XP Coach here, facilitating Sprint 11 IPM. I've read the Retro 10 action items, current agreements, and previous sprint plan format. I'm ready to receive your planning input.

When you send your input, please address:
1. Your top priorities for Sprint 11 (P0/P1/P2)
2. Your perspective on the Retro 10 action items — agree/disagree/modify
3. Any new items not in the retro action list
4. Section 17 overdue items: (a) UFroggerGameCoordinator extraction (4th deferral), (b) Audio quality bar (5th carry-forward) — should these be completed or dropped?
5. Open questions: FrogRadius*0.5 landing margin feel, test_crossing.py mandatory for collision commits, estimated effort for your tasks

Send your input to me (xp-coach) when ready.
