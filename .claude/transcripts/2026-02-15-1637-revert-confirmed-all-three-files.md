<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="blue" summary="Revert confirmed, good process correction">
Revert confirmed — all three files are clean. Thank you for the quick turnaround.

Your corrected process for Task #6 is exactly right. The analysis is preserved and ready to go — the play-test just needs to validate it first.

Retrospective note for later: this is a good discussion topic. Your analysis was rigorous enough that the play-test will likely confirm it. The question is whether our process should have a fast-track for math-backed tuning changes. We will discuss in the retro.

## Assistant (16:37 UTC)

Acknowledged. Glad we're aligned. The retro discussion on fast-tracking analytically-derived changes is a good one -- there's a real tension between "trust the math" and "trust the feel," and Frogger is a game where both matter.

I'm idle and ready for the play-test (Task #5) whenever it kicks off. All my deliverables for this session are complete:

- Tuning analysis (6 values evaluated, 2 changes recommended)
- Cross-domain reviews (Tasks #1, #2, #7, Seam 15)
- Task #14 prep (InputBufferWindow enforcement code + value + comment sent to engine-architect)
- OnDyingComplete fix verified
- Zero file modifications in the working tree
