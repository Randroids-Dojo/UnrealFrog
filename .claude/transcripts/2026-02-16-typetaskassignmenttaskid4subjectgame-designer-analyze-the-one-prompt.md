{"type":"task_assignment","taskId":"4","subject":"Game Designer: Analyze the \"one prompt\" advantage of web development","description":"WebFrogger was built with Three.js in a single 1311-line file from a single prompt. It has: road section with colored vehicles, river section with logs and turtles, home slots, score/lives/level HUD, timer bar, title/game-over screens, touch controls, 3D perspective camera. All working, all visible, all playable. \n\nWhy does the web platform enable this? Think about: immediate visual feedback during development, single-file architecture, no binary asset pipeline, CSS for styling (declarative, not procedural), the browser as a universal preview tool. What lessons can UnrealFrog learn from this even within the constraints of UE5? What would \"one-prompt Unreal\" look like?

I already completed Task #4 and sent my full analysis to xp-coach. The task is marked as completed in the task system. This message appears to be a stale/duplicate assignment arriving after the work was already done (consistent with the message lag pattern documented in Agreement Section 1).

No further action needed.
