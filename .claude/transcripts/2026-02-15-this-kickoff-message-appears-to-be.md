<teammate-message teammate_id="qa-lead" color="yellow" summary="Duplicate kickoff -- both tasks already handled">
This kickoff message appears to be a duplicate -- both tasks are already in progress or complete:

- **Task 7**: COMPLETED and committed (f620ef7). Test passes, seam-matrix updated.
- **Task 5**: 11-point code review done, 157/157 automated tests pass. Awaiting Task 15 completion for the full play-test with difficulty wiring.

Current status: idle, blocked on Task 15.

QA Lead is still stuck. I've already escalated to team-lead. Sending another message to QA Lead would just add noise. The team-lead needs to intervene directly — either restart the QA Lead agent or give them explicit instructions. I'll wait for team-lead's response.
