## Assistant (04:15 UTC)

This is a stale self-assigned task notification from earlier in the session. Task 12 was already completed at the very beginning of this conversation. Let me verify.

- **Used TaskGet** on task 12

## Assistant (04:15 UTC)

Confirmed -- Task 12 has been completed for a while. This was a delayed delivery of my own earlier self-assignment message. No action needed.

Standing by for new work from the team lead.
