<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Retro complete, shutting down team">
Retro finalized, Sprint 7 plan written, agreements updated with Section 18. All votes recorded. Thank you for the honest perspectives — this was the best retro we've had. Shutting down the team now.
</teammate-message>

Understood. Good retrospective — the play-test blocking gate and domain-expert review agreement are the two most important outcomes. I'll be ready to execute the full gameplay play-test as the first Sprint 7 task.

Now let me update my agent memory with the Sprint 7 plan outcomes before shutdown.

Agent memory updated with Sprint 7 plan, play-test checklist, and retro outcomes. Ready for shutdown whenever the team lead sends the request.
