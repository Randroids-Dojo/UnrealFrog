<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="blue" summary="All resolved — stand by for play-test, no more confirmation needed">
Everything you are confirming has been resolved and acknowledged. The revert is clean, Phase 0 is committed (commits `154320e` and `f620ef7`), builds passed, and there are no blockers from your side.

The only active work item right now is **Task #15** (wire wave difficulty to hazard spawning), assigned to the engine-architect. You are standing by until the play-test starts.

No further confirmation needed on the revert. We are aligned.
