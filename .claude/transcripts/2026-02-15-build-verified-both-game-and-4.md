<teammate-message teammate_id="engine-architect" color="green" summary="Build verified, Phase 1 unblocked">
BUILD VERIFIED — both Game and Editor targets succeed. Phase 0 is complete (Tasks 1-4 done).

Phase 1 is now UNBLOCKED:
- **QA Lead**: Task #5 (play-test) is yours. Run `Tools/PlayUnreal/run-tests.sh --all` first to verify all tests pass, then begin the 11-point verification checklist.
- **Game Designer**: Task #6 (tuning pass) is live. Read the current values and prepare your analysis. Remember: evaluate first, propose changes only after play-test data.

Let's go.

## Assistant (17:00 UTC)

Stale message. Task 5 is already completed — 11/11 play-test points PASS, 160/160 automated tests passing. Report was sent to the team lead earlier. Standing by.
