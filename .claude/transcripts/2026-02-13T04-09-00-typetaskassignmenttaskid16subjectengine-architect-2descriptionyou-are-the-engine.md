That appears to be an echo of my own task assignment from earlier. Task 16 is already completed -- I finished the full UScoreSubsystem implementation (tests, header, and .cpp) and reported to the team lead.

Let me check if there is any new work available.

## Assistant (04:09 UTC)

No unblocked tasks available for me. Task 4 (collision/death) is blocked by Task 3 (lane-based hazard system), and Task 6 (game state machine) is blocked by Task 4. The critical path runs through the hazard system work.

## Assistant (04:09 UTC)

Standing by for the next assignment from the team lead. All scoring subsystem work is complete and ready for review.
