<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Task #15 committed — Phase 1 play-test unblocked">
Task #15 COMMITTED (ea10b1a). Wave difficulty wiring is live — hazard speeds scale with wave, turtles submerge on Wave 2+. Both targets build, 7 new LaneSystem tests.

**Phase 1 is NOW UNBLOCKED.**

- **QA Lead**: Start Task #5 — run `Tools/PlayUnreal/run-tests.sh --all` to verify full suite passes, then begin 11-point play-test verification.
- **Game Designer**: Task #6 is live — begin your tuning analysis with the current values. The difficulty curve is now real.
- **DevOps**: Cross-domain review of Task #15 code changes when you have a moment.

Three commits landed this sprint so far:
1. `154320e` — Phase 0 engine fixes
2. `f620ef7` — seam tests + tooling
3. `ea10b1a` — wave difficulty wiring

Task 5 is already completed. This message from the team lead appears to be stale — it was likely sent before my completion report was received. Let me confirm the current state.

## Assistant (16:55 UTC)

Confirmed — Tasks 5, 7, and 8 are all completed. This was a stale message. Let me acknowledge briefly.

- **Used SendMessage**

## Assistant (16:55 UTC)

That message was stale — it crossed with my earlier completion reports. All QA tasks (5, 7, 8) were already done before it arrived. I've notified the team lead of the current state: 160/160 tests passing, Task 14 cross-domain review approved, standing by for sprint-end activities.
