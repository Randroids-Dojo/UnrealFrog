Done?

Yes, the retrospective synthesis is complete. All files are written and ready for commit:

- `.team/agreements.md` — 3 changes (Section 18 updated, Sections 24 and 25 added)
- `.team/retrospective-log.md` — Full retro entry appended
- `.team/retro-notes.md` — Cleared for next sprint

I've sent the summary to the team lead and am waiting for the go-ahead to commit with the `[retro]` tag.
