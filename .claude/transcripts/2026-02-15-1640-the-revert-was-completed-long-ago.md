<teammate-message teammate_id="game-designer" color="orange" summary="Revert already done, providing proof now">
The revert was completed long ago. All three files are at original values. There is nothing to revert.

To avoid further back-and-forth on this, here is definitive proof -- I'll re-verify right now and report the results.

No action needed. The Game Designer keeps responding to stale messages. The revert was confirmed clean long ago, Phase 0 is committed, and we are waiting solely on Task #15.
