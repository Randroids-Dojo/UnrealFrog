<teammate-message teammate_id="devops-engineer" color="blue" summary="Retro items acknowledged, standing by">
Acknowledged all 3 retro items. Added BSD sed gotcha and qualified-reference pattern to MEMORY.md.

Agree on all proposals:
1. File edit locking/claiming — structural gap, not agent failure
2. Section 19 extending to UBT builds — would prevent ConflictingInstance waste
3. Qualified reference convention — `module.CONST` for runtime-mutable globals

Standing by for retro. No further work needed from DevOps this sprint.

Good, DevOps is aligned on all retro proposals and standing by. No action needed from me -- their acknowledgment confirms we are in sync on the retrospective agenda.

Let me check if there are any updates on the VFX investigation (the one remaining task).

## Assistant (07:04 UTC)

VFX investigation is still pending -- no one has claimed it yet. Engine Architect had pre-read notes on it (retro notes line 14) but may be finishing other work or waiting for direction.

## Assistant (07:04 UTC)

Waiting on team-lead's decision about the VFX investigation and whether to call the sprint. No action needed from me right now -- I have already:

1. Sent the status question to team-lead
2. Retro notes are up to date (14 entries)
3. Retro agenda is prepared (3 process issues, 2 positive patterns)
4. DevOps is aligned and standing by
5. Cross-domain review readiness confirmed for Task #3

Standing by for team-lead's direction.
