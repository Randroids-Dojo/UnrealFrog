## Assistant (00:04 UTC)

That's a stale task assignment message -- it's the original task that kicked off this retrospective work, which is already complete. This is an example of the message lag pattern documented in Agreement Section 1.

- **Used TaskGet** on task 4

## Assistant (00:04 UTC)

Let me mark this as completed since all the retrospective work is done.

- **Used TaskUpdate** on task 4

## Assistant (00:04 UTC)

Task 4 is now marked completed. The Sprint 8 retrospective is fully done:

- Retrospective entry written in `/Users/randroid/Documents/Dev/Unreal/UnrealFrog/.team/retrospective-log.md`
- Agreements updated in `/Users/randroid/Documents/Dev/Unreal/UnrealFrog/.team/agreements.md` (Sections 5a, 9, 20, new 21)
- Stakeholder directive broadcast to all active teammates
- XP Coach memory updated

Standing by for any further coordination needs.
