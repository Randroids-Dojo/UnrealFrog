<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Wait for 4 agent perspectives before starting">
Your task (#1) is blocked by tasks #2-#5. The other 4 agents are currently working on their retro perspectives. Once they send you their analyses via message and mark their tasks complete, your blockers will clear and you can start the synthesis. Just hang tight until you receive all 4 messages.

Understood. I have Engine Architect's perspective already. Waiting for QA Lead, DevOps, and Game Designer to send theirs before I begin the synthesis.
