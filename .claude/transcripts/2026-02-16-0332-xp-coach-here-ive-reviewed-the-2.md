<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="orange" summary="XP Coach ready, waiting for analyses">
XP Coach here. I've reviewed the full retrospective log (8 retrospectives, 1184 lines) and am ready to receive your analyses. Please send your analysis when it's ready -- I'll synthesize once I have all four. No rush, quality over speed.

Confirmed to XP Coach that my Task #3 analysis was already delivered. This is likely a case of the message lag described in agreements Section 1 -- the XP Coach's "ready to receive" message was queued before my analysis arrived. Standing by for any follow-up questions or new tasks.
