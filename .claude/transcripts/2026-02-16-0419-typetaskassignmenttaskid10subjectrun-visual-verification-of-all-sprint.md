Death puff VFX — large enough at Z=2200? At frog position? (partially verified in hotfix)\n2. Score pops — appear near frog, not top-left corner?\n3. Home slot celebrations — at correct grid positions?\n4. Ground color — changes between waves?\n5. Wave fanfare — text animates during transition?\n6. Hop dust — visible at hop origin?\n\nTake screenshots for each. Fix anything that doesn't work. This is the §5a step 4 gate.\n\nOwner: qa-lead\nDepends on: build-and-verify.sh, expanded verify_visuals.py","assignedBy":"qa-lead","timestamp":"2026-02-16T03:54:03.708Z"}
