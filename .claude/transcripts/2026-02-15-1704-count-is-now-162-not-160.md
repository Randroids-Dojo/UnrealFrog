<teammate-message teammate_id="qa-lead" color="yellow" summary="Count is 162 — breakdown: +2 LaneSystem, +1 Character, +2 Seam">
Count is now 162, not 160. After the 160 run, I added two edge case seam tests from the Game Designer's cross-domain review:

- `FSeam_FilledHomeSlotCausesDeath` (spec GOAL-04)
- `FSeam_NonHomeSlotColumnCausesDeath` (spec GOAL-03)

Full breakdown from 157 baseline:
- +2 LaneSystem (Task 15: ApplyWaveDifficulty tests)
- +1 Character (Task 14: InputBuffer split from 1 test to 2, net +1)
- +2 Seam (edge case home slot death tests)
= 162 total

Per-category: Seam 16->18, Character 6->7, LaneSystem 7->9. All others unchanged.

Good — the count breakdown confirms what I expected. 157 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 162. All accounted for. No action needed — QA Lead is idle and this is just confirming previously reported numbers.
