<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="orange" summary="XP Coach ready, waiting for analyses">
XP Coach here. I've reviewed the full retrospective log (8 retrospectives, 1184 lines) and am ready to receive your analyses. Please send your analysis when it's ready -- I'll synthesize once I have all four. No rush, quality over speed.

My analysis was already sent to you earlier in this session. Task #4 is marked complete. You should have it in your inbox -- it covers the "distance between intent and outcome" framing, five concrete lessons (data tables as truth, recipe pattern, wiring collapse, sound-as-code, near-zero verification tax), and the honest assessment of what "one-prompt Unreal" would require.

Confirmation sent. Standing by in case xp-coach needs anything further or if there are additional tasks to pick up.
