<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="blue" summary="Already fixed in commit f620ef7, standing by">
Already fixed. Commit `f620ef7` disabled ChaosSolverPlugin in .uproject — your root cause analysis is correct but the fix was applied as part of the Phase 0 commit batch. Headless tests should work now.

You are standing by. The only active work item is Task #15 (engine-architect). I will notify you if anything needs your attention.

## Assistant (16:45 UTC)

Acknowledged. Test suite verified at 157/157 after the fix. Standing by.
