That appears to be a duplicate/echo of my own task assignment from the previous session. Task #2 is already completed -- I delivered my full Sprint 2 design input to the team lead.

Let me check if there are any new tasks or messages waiting for me.

No new tasks in the queue. I am idle and ready for the next assignment from the team lead. My Sprint 2 design input (camera, input, HUD, game flow, minimum playable definition, and spec divergence report) has already been delivered.
