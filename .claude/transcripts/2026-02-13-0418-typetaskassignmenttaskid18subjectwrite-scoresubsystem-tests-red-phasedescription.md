Stale self-assigned notification. Task 18 was completed earlier -- the QA lead had already written the tests.

- **Used TaskGet** on task 18

Confirmed complete. I also see the team agreements were updated during the Sprint 1 retrospective -- notably, the mob programming rule now allows multiple drivers on non-overlapping files. Good evolution.

Standing by for new work.
