<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Retro complete, shutting down team">
Retro finalized, Sprint 7 plan written, agreements updated with Section 18. All votes recorded. Thank you for the honest perspectives — this was the best retro we've had. Shutting down the team now.

Understood. Good retro -- the play-test gap and scope discipline discussions were overdue. Ready to shut down.

Let me update my memory with Sprint 6 retro outcomes before shutting down.

Memory updated with Sprint 6 retro outcomes and Sprint 7 plan. Ready for shutdown whenever the team lead sends the request.
