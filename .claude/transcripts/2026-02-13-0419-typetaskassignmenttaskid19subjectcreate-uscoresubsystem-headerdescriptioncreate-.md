Stale self-assigned notification. Task 19 was completed earlier in the session.

- **Used TaskGet** on task 19

Confirmed complete. I also notice another retrospective update: the workflow now says "same agent writes test AND implementation" to prevent API mismatch -- a lesson learned from Sprint 1 where the QA lead and I had different API assumptions. Good improvement.

Standing by for new work.
