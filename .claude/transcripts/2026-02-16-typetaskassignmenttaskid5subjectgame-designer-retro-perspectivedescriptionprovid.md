Focus on:\n- The platform landing feel: capsule radius (34 UU) margin — is this the right game feel? Too strict? Too forgiving? Classic Frogger has specific log-landing forgiveness.\n- The path planner PLATFORM_INSET of 44 UU (34 + 10 buffer) — does the AI frog play like a human would, or is it too conservative/aggressive?\n- The one-hop-at-a-time strategy achieved 35 hops, 1 death, 19.9s for a crossing. Is this good gameplay? What would a skilled human player look like?\n- Drift-aware platform prediction — does this create natural-feeling navigation or robotic behavior?\n\nRead the Sprint 10 commits and .team/retro-notes.md, then send your analysis to xp-coach.","assignedBy":"game-designer","timestamp":"2026-02-16T05:44:09.310Z"}

Task #5 is already completed. I sent my full retro analysis to the XP Coach in the previous turn. Let me verify the current task state.

## Assistant (05:45 UTC)

All retro perspectives (#2-#5) are now complete. Task #1 (the retrospective facilitation) is pending and owned by xp-coach -- it's no longer blocked. No tasks are available for me to pick up. I'm idle and waiting for the next assignment.
