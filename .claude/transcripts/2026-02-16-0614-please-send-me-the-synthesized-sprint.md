Sprint 11 plan is written to `/Users/randroid/Documents/Dev/Unreal/UnrealFrog/Docs/Planning/sprint11-plan.md` and task #5 is marked complete. The plan synthesizes all 4 agent perspectives into 15 tasks across P0/P1/P2 with clear dependency chains, driver assignments, and acceptance criteria. Implementation can begin with Phase 1 (baseline build verification by DevOps).
