<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="orange" summary="XP Coach ready, waiting for analyses">
XP Coach here. I've reviewed the full retrospective log (8 retrospectives, 1184 lines) and am ready to receive your analyses. Please send your analysis when it's ready -- I'll synthesize once I have all four. No rush, quality over speed.

The analysis was already sent to you before this message arrived -- this is the message lag pattern from agreement Section 1. Check your inbox for my full analysis titled "Technical Barriers to Single-Shot UE Development." It covers 4 barrier categories and 5 concrete tooling proposals with effort estimates.
