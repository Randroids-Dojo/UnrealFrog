<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="blue" summary="Phase 0 committed, you are caught up, standing by">
You are working from stale state. Phase 0 is fully committed — the OnDyingComplete fix is in commit `154320e`, the seam tests and ChaosSolverPlugin fix are in `f620ef7`. Both builds passed. Cross-domain review is no longer needed since the changes are committed.

The current blocker is Task #15 (wire wave difficulty to hazard spawning) — engine-architect is working on it. You are standing by. I will notify you if anything needs your attention.
