Verified. Header diff only shows forward declarations and cached pointers -- no DifficultySpeedIncrement change. Seam test values are correct.

Standing by for the OnDyingComplete SaveHighScore fix or further instructions.

Waiting on the engine-architect for Task #15. Let me check if any progress has been made.

- **Used Bash**: Check for Task #15 changes

Only the engine-architect's memory file has changed — no source code changes yet for Task #15. They may be designing their approach before writing code (per agreement section 3: design debate before implementation).

The sprint is in a holding pattern on Task #15. All other agents are standing by. Nothing for me to do except wait and be ready to navigate when the engine-architect starts implementing.
