<teammate-message teammate_id="game-designer" color="orange" summary="Status: analysis done, review done, waiting on blockers">
Status update: All pre-work for Task #6 is complete. Created Task #14 for the InputBufferWindow enforcement bug I found during analysis.

Current state:
- Tuning analysis: DONE (sent earlier, 6 values evaluated, 2 changes recommended)
- Cross-domain review of Task #1: DONE (found save point in wrong method, sent fix to engine-architect)
- Task #14 created: InputBufferWindow bug (new P0-ish fix)
- Waiting: Task #6 still blocked by #1 and #2
- Available: Ready to review Task #2 (duplicate wave-complete) when engine-architect is ready

Anything else I can contribute to while blocked?
