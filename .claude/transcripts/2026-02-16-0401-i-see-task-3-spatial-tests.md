<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Confirming Task 3 completion status">
I see Task 3 (spatial tests) is complete. Nice work. Did all spatial tests pass? How many tests total now? What systems did you cover?

Your tasks are done. Stand by — I may need you if QA finds visual bugs that need C++ fixes.

Standing by. Both assigned tasks complete, full test suite green, both build targets verified.
