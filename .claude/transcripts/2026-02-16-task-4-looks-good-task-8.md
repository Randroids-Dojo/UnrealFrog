<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Task 3 waiting on DevOps Task 2">
Task 4 looks good. Task 8 (baseline build) is done. Task 2 (--spatial filter) is still pending — I've asked DevOps to prioritize it. Once Task 2 is done you're unblocked for Task 3 (spatial tests). Stand by.

Stale message from the team lead -- they sent it before my completion reports arrived. Per Agreement Section 1, this is expected multi-agent message lag. I've confirmed the current state and am standing by.
