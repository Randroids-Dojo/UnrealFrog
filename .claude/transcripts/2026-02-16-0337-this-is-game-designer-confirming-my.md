<teammate-message teammate_id="game-designer" color="yellow" summary="Confirming analysis already sent, check inbox">
This is Game Designer confirming: my Task #4 analysis was already sent to you earlier in this session. It should be in your inbox. The analysis covers:

1. Why the web platform enables single-prompt games (6 specific comparisons: colors as values vs pipelines, meshes as geometry calls, layout as arithmetic, sound as synthesis, HUD as HTML, verification as "open the file")
2. Five lessons for UnrealFrog (data tables as single source of truth, recipe pattern for visuals, collapse the wiring problem, sound as code, near-zero verification tax)
3. What "one-prompt Unreal" would look like (4 layers: declarative scene format, instant preview, intent-based description, verification as side effect)

If you don't have it, let me know and I'll resend. This may be message lag per Agreement Section 1.

## Assistant (03:38 UTC)

Confirmed -- your analysis was received, captured, and already synthesized into the retrospective entry. All six of your web-vs-UE comparisons made it into the "Why Web Dev Works" section, and your declarative scene description proposal is in the roadmap as a Phase 2 initiative (Sprint 10-11). Task #1 is complete and delivered.
