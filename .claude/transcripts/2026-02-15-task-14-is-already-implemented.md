<teammate-message teammate_id="engine-architect" color="green" summary="Task #14 already implemented, stale message">
Task #14 is already implemented — the enforcement fix, the 0.08s value, and the updated test assertion are all in the staged working tree. This message was sent before the work was done.

The design rationale is good. I did not add the extended comment block to the header (per project convention of not adding comments where the logic is self-evident from the property name and the enforcement code), but the value and behavior match your specification exactly.

Understood. These messages are all catching up to work that's already been applied. My Task #6 changes are in the working tree and reviewed. Standing by for xp-coach on build verification.
