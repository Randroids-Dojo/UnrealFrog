{"type":"task_assignment","taskId":"5","subject":"QA Lead: What would \"instant verification\" look like for UE development?","description":"The fundamental QA problem: in web dev, the agent can see what it built instantly. In UE dev, the agent writes code, compiles, and hopes. 170 tests pass but the game looks identical to before the sprint. \n\nWhat would an ideal verification workflow look like for agentic UE development? Think about: screenshot-driven development (write code, compile, screenshot, iterate), PlayUnreal as a development tool not just a testing tool, visual regression baselines, the agent seeing its own work as part of the development loop (not just at the end). How do we make \"launch and look\" as natural as \"save and refresh\"? Send your analysis to xp-coach.","assignedBy":"qa-lead","timestamp":"2026-02-16T03:31:07.748Z"}

This task assignment is a duplicate of Task #5, which I have already completed. I analyzed the verification gap, read all relevant test files (`VFXTest.cpp`, `HUDTest.cpp`, `PlayUnrealTest.cpp`, `verify_visuals.py`, `qa_checklist.py`, `client.py`), and sent my full analysis to the XP Coach.

The analysis is delivered. No further action needed on this task.

## Assistant (03:33 UTC)

All four domain analyses (Tasks 2-5) are complete. Task 1 (the XP Coach's synthesis) is in progress. I have no remaining tasks. Standing by for any follow-up requests from the team.
