<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="blue" summary="Phase 0 done — play-test imminent after build passes">
Phase 0 is code-complete. The OnDyingComplete SaveHighScore fix has been applied and verified. Tasks #1, #2, #3 are all done.

Build verification is running now (Game + Editor targets). Once both pass, Task #5 (play-test) is go. Prepare the 11-point checklist. The Game Designer will join you to evaluate gameplay feel for the tuning pass.

Reminder: the DifficultySpeedIncrement is still at 0.1 (the original value). Your seam test values are correct as-is.

Acknowledged. This is a stale message — Task 5 was completed earlier this session with the full 11-point play-test report (11/11 PASS at code level, 160/160 automated tests passing). The report was sent to the team lead.

All QA tasks (5, 7, 8) are done. Standing by for new assignments or sprint-end activities.
