<teammate-message teammate_id="qa-lead" color="yellow" summary="Idle, all work blocked on Task 15">
Standing by. All my current work is blocked on Task 15 (wave difficulty wiring). Summary of completed work this session:

1. Task 7 (Seam 14 test) -- COMPLETE, both targets build, test passes
2. Seam 15 improvements -- AddExpectedError + wave counter incorporated per your feedback
3. 11-point code review -- all 11 points verified at code level
4. Full test suite run -- 157/157 pass, 0 fail

Task 5 (play-test) remains blocked by Task 15. Task 8 (bug fixes) blocked by Task 5. No other unblocked tasks assigned to me. If there's cross-domain review work or anything else I can pick up, let me know.

QA Lead's message is stale — they haven't received the update that Task #15 was committed. Let me unblock them.

Task list looks correct. QA Lead has been unblocked and directed to proceed with Task #5. Waiting on their play-test results before the sprint can advance further. No action needed from me right now — monitoring mode.
