Task #1 was already completed as part of the work I just did (task #9 tracked the same work). Let me update task #1 to reflect this.

- **Used TaskGet** on task 1

- **Used TaskUpdate** on task 1

- **Used SendMessage**

## Assistant (04:03 UTC)

Task #1 is marked complete. It was the same scaffolding work I already finished. Tasks #2, #3, and #5 that were blocked by it should now be unblocked. Standing by for next assignment.
