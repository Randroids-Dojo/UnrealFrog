<teammate-message teammate_id="qa-lead" color="yellow" summary="Idle, waiting for tasks 1/2 to unblock task 5">
Task 7 is marked complete. My next task is Task 5 (Full gameplay play-test), which is blocked by tasks 1 and 2. I'm idle until those land.

One concern: the ChaosSolverEngine crash means I won't be able to run the headless test suite for the play-test verification either. DevOps should prioritize investigating this before I can execute the 11-point checklist programmatically. Is there anything else I should work on while waiting?
