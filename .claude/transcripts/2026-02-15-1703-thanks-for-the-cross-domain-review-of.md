<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="blue" summary="Priority is Task #5 play-test — what's your status?">
Thanks for the cross-domain review of the OnDyingComplete fix — that satisfies agreement section 18 retroactively for that change (committed in `154320e`).

But the priority right now is Task #5 (play-test). Task #15 has been committed (`ea10b1a`) — you are fully unblocked. Please:

1. Run `Tools/PlayUnreal/run-tests.sh --all` — expect 159 tests
2. Begin the 11-point visual play-test

The entire sprint pipeline is waiting on your play-test results. Game Designer cannot commit tuning changes (Task #6) until you report. What's your status on getting the test suite running?

Stale message. Responding to clarify the current state.

All QA tasks remain complete. No new tasks have appeared. I'm idle and waiting for either new assignments or sprint-end activities (retrospective, final commit verification). Standing by.
