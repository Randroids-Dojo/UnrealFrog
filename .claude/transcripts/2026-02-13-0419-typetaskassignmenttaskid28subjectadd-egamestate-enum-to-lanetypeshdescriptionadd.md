## Assistant (04:19 UTC)

Stale self-assigned notification. Task 28 was completed during the game state machine implementation. (EGameState was later moved from LaneTypes.h to UnrealFrogGameMode.h where it belongs.)

- **Used TaskGet** on task 28

## Assistant (04:19 UTC)

Confirmed complete. No action needed. Standing by.
