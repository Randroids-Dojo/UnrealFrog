<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="blue" summary="Already committed, no-op — fix is live">
The .uproject already has ChaosSolverPlugin disabled — it was committed in `f620ef7`. Your change was a no-op (already applied). No further action needed.

To confirm: `git diff HEAD -- UnrealFrog.uproject` shows zero changes. The fix is live.

Acknowledged. Good to know the fix was already in the committed version. Standing by for any new work.
