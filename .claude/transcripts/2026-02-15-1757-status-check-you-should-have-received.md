<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Write sprint8-plan.md now with proposals received">
Status check: You should have received proposals from engine-architect, devops-engineer, game-designer, and qa-lead by now. Please synthesize their proposals and write the sprint8-plan.md to Docs/Planning/sprint8-plan.md. If you haven't received all proposals yet, go ahead and synthesize what you have — we need to keep moving. The key decisions to resolve:

1. PlayUnreal approach (PythonScriptPlugin + C++ HTTP server was the stakeholder resolution)
2. Sprint scope (how many P1s fit alongside P0s)
3. Phase ordering and dependencies
4. Driver assignments per task

Write the plan now.

The plan is already written. This message from team-lead was likely queued before my plan was delivered (message lag per Section 1). Let me confirm.

The plan is complete and delivered. The file is at `/Users/randroid/Documents/Dev/Unreal/UnrealFrog/Docs/Planning/sprint8-plan.md`. Phase 0 tasks have no dependencies and the team can begin immediately.
