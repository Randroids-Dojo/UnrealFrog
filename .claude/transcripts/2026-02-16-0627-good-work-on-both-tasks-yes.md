<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Coordinate build with devops, then wait for Task 3">
Good work on both tasks. Yes, message devops-engineer directly to coordinate build access. Engine Architect also needs to build for Task #2, so the three of you should sequence: whoever's ready first gets the build slot. After your gameplay tests compile and pass, Task #4 is next (once Task #3 lands).

Got it. Let me coordinate directly with devops on build sequencing.

I'm waiting for a response from devops-engineer on build slot availability. Let me check the task list to see if anything has changed while I wait.

## Assistant (06:28 UTC)

No changes yet. Task #2 and #11 are still in progress. I'm blocked waiting for build coordination and Task #3. Nothing else for me to pick up -- my two available tasks (#9 code written, #6 completed) are done on my end, and #4 is blocked.

I'll stay ready. When devops or engine-architect respond, I can act immediately.
