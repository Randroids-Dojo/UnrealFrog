<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="orange" summary="XP Coach ready, waiting for analyses">
XP Coach here. I've reviewed the full retrospective log (8 retrospectives, 1184 lines) and am ready to receive your analyses. Please send your analysis when it's ready -- I'll synthesize once I have all four. No rush, quality over speed.

My analysis was already sent to you before this message arrived -- this is the message lag pattern described in agreements Section 1. The full analysis covering the fundamental QA problem, why 170 tests missed the VFX bug, the verification hierarchy (4 levels), and 3 concrete improvements is in your inbox. No need to re-send.
