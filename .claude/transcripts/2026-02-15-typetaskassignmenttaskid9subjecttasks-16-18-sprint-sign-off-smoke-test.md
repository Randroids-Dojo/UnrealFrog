This is another stale message -- I already claimed Task 9 and completed the seam matrix update (Task 17). Per agreement Section 1: "Accept message lag as normal."

Current status: Task 9 is `in_progress` with me as owner. Task 17 (seam matrix) is done. Tasks 16 (visual smoke test) and 18 (Section 17 drops, XP Coach's responsibility) remain.

I'm waiting for the team lead to confirm next steps -- whether to proceed with Task 16 (visual smoke test script) now or wait for other dependencies.
