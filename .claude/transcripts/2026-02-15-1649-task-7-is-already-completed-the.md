<teammate-message teammate_id="qa-lead" color="yellow" summary="Task 7 already completed, standing by">
Task 7 is already completed. The seam test `FSeam_WaveDifficultyFlowsToLaneConfig` was written, committed (f620ef7), and verified passing (157/157 suite green). The seam-matrix.md was also updated. No action needed on this assignment.

I'm standing by for Task 5 (play-test), still blocked by Task 15.

QA Lead is clearly stuck in a loop, repeatedly reporting they're blocked by Task #15. I've already sent four messages explaining the situation. Sending more of the same won't help — this needs team-lead intervention. I've already escalated. Standing by.
