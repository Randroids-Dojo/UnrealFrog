<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="blue" summary="Task #4 review confirmed, standing by for next work">
Task #4 confirmed complete and reviewed. The placement after validation (lines 109-120) is correct — we validate prerequisites before doing cleanup work. The conditional check with user-facing output is clean.

For cross-domain review: the engine-architect's Phase 0 changes are mostly done but Task #1 still needs one more SaveHighScore call in `OnDyingComplete`. I will notify you when all three tasks are code-complete and the full diff is ready for your review.

In the meantime, you are free — no other tasks need your attention right now unless a new one surfaces during the play-test.

Standing by — my task (#4) is complete and I'm waiting for the xp-coach's notification that the engine-architect's Phase 0 changes (tasks #1, #2, #3) are code-complete and ready for cross-domain review.
