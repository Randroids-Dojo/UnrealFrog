<teammate-message teammate_id="xp-coach" color="blue" summary="Task #15 nearly done, play-test almost unblocked">
Status update: engine-architect's Task #15 (wire wave difficulty) is nearly complete. The LaneManager, HazardBase, and test changes are in the working tree. Two small wiring additions to GameMode.cpp remain (caching the LaneManager pointer in BeginPlay and calling ApplyWaveDifficulty from OnRoundCompleteFinished).

Once those land and build passes, Task #5 (play-test) is unblocked. Stand by — should be soon.

Stale message. Task 15 is committed, Task 5 is completed, 162/162 tests passing. Standing by.
