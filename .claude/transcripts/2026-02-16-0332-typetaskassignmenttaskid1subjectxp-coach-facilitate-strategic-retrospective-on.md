Key question: WebFrogger (1 file, 1311 lines, 1 prompt) produced a working 3D Frogger. UnrealFrog (80 commits, 11393 lines C++, 170+ tests, 8 sprints) still has unverified visual output. The stakeholder says: \"It isn't about a single game. It's about the tools. I want agentic Unreal development to be just as good as agentic web development.\"\n\nAnalyze WHY web dev works in a single shot and UE dev doesn't. Propose concrete, actionable changes to the tools, process, and approach. Write the retrospective entry to the retro log.","assignedBy":"xp-coach","timestamp":"2026-02-16T03:31:26.790Z"}

I already have Task #1 claimed and in_progress. I'm actively waiting for the four analyses from the teammate agents. No action needed on this duplicate assignment notification.
