{"type":"task_assignment","taskId":"3","subject":"DevOps: Analyze tooling gap between web and UE agent workflows","description":"Compare the tooling available for agentic web dev vs agentic UE dev. In web: the agent writes HTML/JS, opens a browser, sees the result instantly, iterates. The feedback loop is seconds. In UE: the agent writes C++, compiles (minutes), launches editor, can't see the screen, writes tests that verify math but not visuals. What tooling investments would close this gap? Analyze PlayUnreal's current state, what's working, what's not, and what the ideal workflow looks like. Think about: hot reload, live preview, screenshot-in-the-loop development, the Remote Control API. Send your analysis to xp-coach.","assignedBy":"devops-engineer","timestamp":"2026-02-16T03:30:40.239Z"}

This task assignment is a duplicate of work I already completed. Task #3 was finished and my full analysis was sent to the XP Coach earlier in this session.

Let me verify the current task state.

## Assistant (03:32 UTC)

Confirmed -- Task #3 is already marked `completed`. The analysis covering the web vs UE feedback loop gap, PlayUnreal's current state, and my top 3 concrete proposals (keep-alive editor + Live Coding, screenshot-in-the-loop, deterministic object paths + state diff) was delivered to `xp-coach` earlier. No further action needed on this task.

No remaining unassigned tasks are available. Standing by for new work.
