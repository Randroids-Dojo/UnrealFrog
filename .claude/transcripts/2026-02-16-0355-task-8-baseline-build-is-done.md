<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead" summary="Prioritize Task 2 to unblock Engine Architect">
Task 8 (baseline build) is done — nice. Please prioritize Task 2 (--spatial filter in run-tests.sh) next, since it's blocking Engine Architect's Task 3 (spatial tests). It's a small change — just add `--spatial` mapping to `UnrealFrog.Spatial` and "Spatial" to KNOWN_CATEGORIES. Then continue with Task 1 (build-and-verify.sh).

All 5 of my tasks are already complete, including Task 2 which was finished before this message arrived. This is the message lag described in agreements Section 1.

To confirm — Task 2 was completed and `--spatial` is live in run-tests.sh. The Engine Architect's Task 3 is unblocked.

Standing by for further assignments or until Task 11 (retrospective) unblocks.
