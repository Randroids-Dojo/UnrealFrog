My retro analysis has been sent to the XP Coach. The retrospective (#1) is still blocked by the QA Lead's perspective (#3). No other tasks are available for me right now.\n**Summary of my retro input:**\n1. **Platform landing is too strict** -- the Sprint 10 change reduced SmallLog landing zone from 200 UU to 132 UU (34% reduction), violating the spec's \"generous landing\" intent. Proposed fix: use half capsule radius (17 UU) as margin instead of full (34 UU), exposed as a tunable UPROPERTY.\n2. **Path planner PLATFORM_INSET is overly conservative** at 44 UU, making the AI land zone only 56% of visual width. Should be reduced to ~25 UU after game-side fix.\n3. **One-hop-at-a-time strategy is reliable but not human-like** -- 19.9s per crossing vs a skilled human doing ~6s.

Here's my gameplay analysis:\n\n### Speed update via HazardPool iteration -- CORRECT\n\n`HazardBase::TickMovement()` (line 78) reads `Speed` directly each tick: `Location.X += Speed * Direction * DeltaTime`. Updating the `Speed` property on existing hazards takes effect immediately next frame. No respawn needed, no visual pop-in, no physics re-initialization. This is the right approach.\n\nStoring base speeds to avoid compounding is also correct -- without it, Wave 3 would be `baseSpeed * 1.1 * 1.2` instead of `baseSpeed * 1.2`. The base speeds come from LaneConfigs which are already stored on LaneManager.\n\n### Gap reduction on existing hazards -- ACCEPTA", "summary": "Task #15 approved with turtle CurrentWave fix -- speed-only approach is correct", "type": "teammate"}, {"time": "16:47", "from": "team-lead", "to": "game-designer", "content": "Good review from Game Designer.
