Game Designer. Evaluate during play-test sessions: (1) HopDuration 0.15s — too slow/fast? (2) HopArcHeight — satisfying arc? (3) InputBufferWindow 0.1s — responsive at Wave 3+? (4) TimePerLevel 30.0s — generous/tight? (5) DifficultySpeedIncrement 0.1/wave — gradual enough? (6) WavesPerGapReduction every 2 waves — progressive? Document findings and recommended changes.
